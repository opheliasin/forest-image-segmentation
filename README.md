## Data
To avoid changing any directory paths in the code, place your images in the folder `data` the main directory. 

The structure of the `data` folder should look like this:
```
data
├── train
│   ├── forest
│   └── deforested
├── test
│   ├── forest
│   └── deforested
└── validation
    ├── forest
    └── deforested
```
##  Packages
Either use conda or venv to manage your packages. 
`requirements.txt` includes all the packages needed to run the code. 
Refer to [this](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) documentation as to how you can install these packages in your virtual environment.
